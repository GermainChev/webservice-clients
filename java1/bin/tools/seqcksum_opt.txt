--stype            	string 	Indicates if the sequences are protein or nucleotide (DNA/RNA).
--cksmethod        	string 	A number of different checksum methods for sequences are launched.
--length           	boolean	Turn on/off the display of asequence length.
--sequence         	string 	Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
