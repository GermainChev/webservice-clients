--diana            	boolean	Show EMBL FT format suitable for diana.
--init             	string 	Model in local/global mode. You should only put the model in global mode if you expect your protein homolog to have homology from start to end to the gene in the DNA sequence.
--splice           	string 	Using splice model or GT/AG? Use the full blown model for splice sites, or a simplistic GT/AG. Generally if you are using a DNA sequence which is from human or worm, then leave this on. If you are using a very different (eg plant) species, switch it off.
--random           	string 	The probability of the model has to compared to an alternative model (in fact to all alternative models which are possible) to allow proper Bayesian inference. This causes considerable difficulty in these algorithms because from a algorithmical point of view we would probably like to use an alternative model which is a single state, like the random model in profile-HMMs, where we can simply 'log-odd' the scored model, whereas from a biological point of view we probably want to use a full gene predicting alternative model. In addition we need to account for the fact that the protein HMM or protein homolog probably does not extend over all the gene sequence, nor in fact does the gene have to be the only gene in the DNA sequence. This means that there are very good splice sites/poly-pyrimidine tracts outside of the 'matched' alignment can severely de-rail the alignment.
--alg              	string 	The solutions is different in the genewise21:93 compared to the genewise 6:23 algorithms. (1) In 6:23 we force the external match portions of the homology model to be identical to the alternative model, thus cancelling each other out. This is a pretty gross approximation and is sort of equivalent to the intron tie'ing. It makes things algorithmically easier... However this means a) 6:23 is nowhere near a probabilistic model and b) you really have to used a tied intron model in 6:23 otherwise very bad edge effects (final introns being ridiculously long) occur. (2) In 21:93 we have a full probabilistic model on each side of the homology segment. This is not reported in the -pretty output but you can see it in the -alb output if you like. Do not trust the gene model outside of the homology segment however. By having these external gene model parts we can use all the gene model features safe in the knowledge that if the homology segments do not justify the match then the external part of the model will soak up the additional intron/py-tract/splice site biases.
--asequence        	string 	The protein sequence can be entered directly into this form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is a limit of 1MB for the sequence entry.
--bsequence        	string 	The DNA sequence to be compared can be entered directly into the form. The sequence must be in a recognised format eg. GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is a limit of 1MB for the sequence entry.
