  --matrix              The comparison matrix to be used to score alignments when
                        searching the database.
  --gapopen             Penalty taken away from the score when a gap is created in
                        sequence. Increasing the gap opening penalty will decrease
                        the number of gaps in the final alignment.
  --gapext              Penalty taken away from the score for each base or residue
                        in the gap. Increasing the gap extension penalty favours
                        short gaps in the final alignment, conversly, decreasing the
                        gap extension penalty favours long gaps in the final
                        alignment.
  --expthr              Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This value is the maximum number of
                        times the match is expected to occur by chance.
  --mask                Turn on/off the sequence masking for HOEs in PSSM
                        constructions. This option allows you to mask sequence
                        characters beyond the alignment region when constructing the
                        PSSM, reducing over-extension errors.
  --psithr              Expectation value threshold for automatic selection of
                        matched sequences for inclusion in the PSSM at each
                        iteration.
  --scores              Maximum number of alignment score summaries reported in the
                        result output.
  --alignments          Maximum number of alignments reported in the result output.
  --hsps                Turn on/off the display of all significant alignments
                        between query and database sequence.
  --scoreformat         Different score formats.
  --filter              Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid
                        issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found
                        due to composition rather then meaningful sequence
                        similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks
                        regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
  --hist                Turn on/off the histogram in the PSI-Search result. The
                        histogram gives a qualitative view of how well the
                        statistical theory fits the similarity scores calculated by
                        the program.
  --annotfeats          Turn on/off annotation features. Annotation features shows
                        features from UniProtKB, such as variants, active sites,
                        phospho-sites and binding sites that have been found in the
                        aligned region of the database hit. To see the annotation
                        features in the results after this has been enabled, select
                        sequences of interest and click to 'Show' Alignments. This
                        option also enables a new result tab (Domain Diagrams) that
                        highlights domain regions.
  --sequence            The query sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. A partially formatted sequence
                        is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence
                        may help certain applications understand the input. Note
                        that directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --database            The databases to run the sequence similarity search against.
                        Multiple databases can be selected at the same time.
  --previousjobid       The job identifier for the previous PSI-Search iteration.
  --selectedHits        List of identifiers from the hits of the previous iteration
                        to use to construct the search PSSM for this iteration.
  --bdrfile             Boundary file containing boundary information for pre-
                        selected sequences.Used for hardmask to clean HOEs.
  --cpfile              Checkpoint file from the previous iteration. Must be in
                        ASN.1 Binary Format.
