  --format              Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
  --tree                The guide tree to output.
  --sequence            Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered
                        directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA,
                        EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present. There is currently a sequence
                        input limit of 500 sequences and 1MB of data.
