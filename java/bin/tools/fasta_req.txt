  --program             The FASTA program to be used for the Sequence Similarity
                        Search.
  --stype               Indicates if the query sequence is protein, DNA or RNA. Used
                        to force FASTA to interpret the input sequence as specified
                        type of sequence (via. the '-p', '-n' or '-U' options), this
                        prevents issues when using nucleotide sequences that contain
                        many ambiguous residues.
  --matrix              (Protein searches) The substitution matrix used for scoring
                        alignments when searching the database. Target identity is
                        the average alignment identity the matrix would produce in
                        the absence of homology and can be used to compare different
                        matrix types. Alignment boundaries are more accurate when
                        the alignment identity matches the target identity
                        percentage.
  --match_scores        (Nucleotide searches) The match score is the bonus to the
                        alignment score when matching the same base. The mismatch is
                        the penalty when failing to match.
  --gapopen             Score for the first residue in a gap.
  --gapext              Score for each additional residue in a gap.
  --hsps                Turn on/off the display of all significant alignments
                        between query and library sequence.
  --expupperlim         Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This is the maximum number of times
                        the match is expected to occur by chance.
  --explowlim           Limit the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This is the minimum number of times
                        the match is expected to occur by chance. This allows
                        closely related matches to be excluded from the result in
                        favor of more distant relationships.
  --strand              For nucleotide sequences specify the sequence strand to be
                        used for the search. By default both upper (provided) and
                        lower (reverse complement of provided) strands are used, for
                        single stranded sequences searching with only the upper or
                        lower strand may provide better results.
  --hist                Turn on/off the histogram in the FASTA result. The histogram
                        gives a qualitative view of how well the statistical theory
                        fits the similarity scores calculated by the program.
  --scores              Maximum number of match score summaries reported in the
                        result output.
  --alignments          Maximum number of match alignments reported in the result
                        output.
  --scoreformat         Different score report formats.
  --stats               The statistical routines assume that the library contains a
                        large sample of unrelated sequences. Options to select what
                        method to use include regression, maximum likelihood
                        estimates, shuffles, or combinations of these.
  --annotfeats          Turn on/off annotation features. Annotation features shows
                        features from UniProtKB, such as variants, active sites,
                        phospho-sites and binding sites that have been found in the
                        aligned region of the database hit. To see the annotation
                        features in the results after this has been enabled, select
                        sequences of interest and click to 'Show' Alignments. This
                        option also enables a new result tab (Domain Diagrams) that
                        highlights domain regions.
  --annotsym            Specify the annotation symbols.
  --dbrange             Specify the sizes of the sequences in a database to search
                        against. For example: 100-250 will search all sequences in a
                        database with length between 100 and 250 residues,
                        inclusive.
  --seqrange            Specify a range or section of the input sequence to use in
                        the search. Example: Specifying '34-89' in an input sequence
                        of total length 100, will tell FASTA to only use residues 34
                        to 89, inclusive.
  --filter              Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid
                        issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found
                        due to composition rather then meaningful sequence
                        similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks
                        regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
  --transltable         Query Genetic code to use in translation.
  --sequence            The query sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only),
                        GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein
                        only) format. A partially formatted sequence is not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --database            The databases to run the sequence similarity search against.
                        Multiple databases can be used at the same time.
  --ktup                FASTA uses a rapid word-based lookup strategy to speed the
                        initial phase of the similarity search. The KTUP is used to
                        control the sensitivity of the search. Lower values lead to
                        more sensitive, but slower searches.
