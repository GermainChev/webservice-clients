  --matrix              The comparison matrix to be used to score alignments when
                        searching the database.
  --gapopen             Penalty taken away from the score when a gap is created in
                        sequence. Increasing the gap openning penalty will decrease
                        the number of gaps in the final alignment.
  --gapext              Penalty taken away from the score for each base or residue
                        in the gap. Increasing the gap extension penalty favors
                        short gaps in the final alignment, conversly decreasing the
                        gap extension penalty favors long gaps in the final
                        alignment.
  --expthr              Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This is the maximum number of times
                        the match is expected to occur by chance.
  --psithr              Expectation value threshold for automatic selection of
                        matched sequences for inclusion in PSSM at each iteration.
  --scores              Maximum number of match score summaries reported in the
                        result output.
  --alignments          Maximum number of match alignments reported in the result
                        output.
  --alignView           Formating for the alignments.
  --dropoff             The amount a score can drop before extension of word hits is
                        halted.
  --finaldropoff        Dropoff value for final gapped alignment.
  --filter              Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid
                        issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found
                        due to composition rather than meaningful sequence
                        similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks
                        regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
  --seqrange            Specify a range or section of the input sequence to use in
                        the search. Example: Specifying '34-89' in an input sequence
                        of total length 100, will tell BLAST to only use residues 34
                        to 89, inclusive.
  --sequence            The query sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. A partially formatted sequence
                        is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence
                        may help certain applications understand the input. Note
                        that directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --database            The databases to run the sequence similarity search against.
                        Multiple databases can be used at the same time.
  --previousjobid       The job identifier for the previous PSI-BLAST iteration.
  --selectedHits        List of identifiers of the hits from the previous iteration
                        to use to construct the search PSSM for this iteration.
  --cpfile              Checkpoint file from the previous iteration. Must be in
                        ASN.1 Binary Format.
  --umode               Usage mode for PHI-BLAST functionality.
  --patfile             Pattern file for PHI-BLAST functionality. This file needs to
                        be in the style of a prosite entry file, with at least an ID
                        line, PA line and optional HI line.
