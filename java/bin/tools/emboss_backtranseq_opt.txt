--codontable       	string 	Codon usage table name
--sequence         	string 	One or more sequences to be translated can be entered directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
