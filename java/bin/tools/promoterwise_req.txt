  --hitoutput           Hit list output format.
  --asequence           The first DNA sequence to be aligned can be entered directly
                        into the form. The sequence must be in a recognised format
                        eg. GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank. Partially formatted sequences
                        are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence
                        may help certain applications understand the input. Note
                        that directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present. There is a limit of 1MB for the sequence entry.
  --bsequence           The second DNA sequence to be aligned can be entered
