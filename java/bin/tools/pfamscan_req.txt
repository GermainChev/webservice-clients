  --database            The database(s) to search.
  --evalue              Expectation value cut-off.
  --asp                 Predict active site residues for Pfam-A matches.
  --format              Output format.
  --sequence            The input sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in FASTA or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format.
                        A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a
                        return to the end of the sequence may help certain
                        applications understand the input. Note that directly using
                        data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present.
