  --guidetreeout        Output guide tree.
  --dismatout           Output distance matrix. This is only calculated if the mBed-
                        like clustering guide tree is set to false.
  --dealign             Remove any existing alignment (gaps) from input sequences.
  --mbed                This option uses a sample of the input sequences and then
                        represents all sequences as vectors to these sequences,
                        enabling much more rapid generation of the guide tree,
                        especially when the number of sequences is large.
  --mbediteration       Use mBed-like clustering during subsequent iterations.
  --iterations          Number of (combined guide-tree/HMM) iterations.
  --gtiterations        Having set the number of combined iterations, this parameter
                        can be changed to limit the number of guide tree iterations
                        within the combined iterations.
  --hmmiterations       Having set the number of combined iterations, this parameter
                        can be changed to limit the number of HMM iterations within
                        the combined iterations.
  --outfmt              Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
  --order               The order in which the sequences appear in the final
                        alignment.
  --stype               Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned.
  --sequence            Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered
                        directly into this box. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL
                        (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present. There is currently a sequence
                        input limit of 4000 sequences and 4MB of data.
