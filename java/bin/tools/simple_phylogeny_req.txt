  --tree                Determines the outputs that the Simple Phylogeny tool
                        produces.
  --kimura              Controls whether Simple Phylogeny attempts to correct for
                        multiple substitutions at the same site. This is recommended
                        to be set 'on' for more divergent sequences and has the
                        effect of stretching branch lengths. For very divergent
                        sequences the distances cannot be reliably corrected.
  --tossgaps            With this option enabled columns where any of the sequences
                        in the input have a gap will be excluded, forcing the
                        alignment to use only positions where information can be
                        included from all sequences.
  --clustering          Clustering Methods.
  --pim                 Output the percentage identity matrix.
  --sequence            Phylogeny using an alignment directly entered into the input
                        box in a supported format. Alignment formats supported
                        include Clustal, FASTA and MSF. Partially formatted or
                        unaligned sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help the Simple Phylogeny tool
                        understand the input. Note that directly using data from
                        word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present. There is currently
                        a limit of 500 sequences and 1MB of data.
