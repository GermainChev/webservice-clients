  --program             The BLAST program to be used for the Sequence Similarity
                        Search.
  --task                Task option (only selectable for blastn).
  --matrix              (Protein searches) The substitution matrix used for scoring
                        alignments when searching the database.
  --alignments          Maximum number of match alignments reported in the result
                        output.
  --scores              Maximum number of match score summaries reported in the
                        result output.
  --exp                 Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This is the maximum number of times
                        the match is expected to occur by chance.
  --dropoff             The amount a score can drop before gapped extension of word
                        hits is halted.
  --match_scores        (Nucleotide searches) The match score is the bonus to the
                        alignment score when matching the same base. The mismatch is
                        the penalty when failing to match.
  --gapopen             Penalty taken away from the score when a gap is created in
                        sequence. Increasing the gap openning penalty will decrease
                        the number of gaps in the final alignment.
  --gapext              Penalty taken away from the score for each base or residue
                        in the gap. Increasing the gap extension penalty favors
                        short gaps in the final alignment, conversly decreasing the
                        gap extension penalty favors long gaps in the final
                        alignment.
  --filter              Filter regions of low sequence complexity. This can avoid
                        issues with low complexity sequences where matches are found
                        due to composition rather than meaningful sequence
                        similarity. However in some cases filtering also masks
                        regions of interest and so should be used with caution.
  --seqrange            Specify a range or section of the input sequence to use in
                        the search. Example: Specifying '34-89' in an input sequence
                        of total length 100, will tell BLAST to only use residues 34
                        to 89, inclusive.
  --gapalign            This is a true/false setting that tells the program the
                        perform optimised alignments within regions involving gaps.
                        If set to true, the program will perform an alignment using
                        gaps. Otherwise, if it is set to false, it will report only
                        individual HSP where two sequence match each other, and thus
                        will not produce alignments with gaps.
  --compstats           Use composition-based statistics.
  --align               Formating for the alignments.
  --transltable         Query Genetic code to use in translation.
  --stype               Indicates if the sequence is protein or DNA/RNA.
  --sequence            The query sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only),
                        GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein
                        only) format. A partially formatted sequence is not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --database            Database.
