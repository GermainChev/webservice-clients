  --goterms             Switch on look-up of corresponding Gene Ontology annotations.
  --pathways            Switch on look-up of corresponding pathway annotations.
  --appl                A number of different protein sequence applications are
                        launched. These applications search against specific
                        databases and have preconfigured cut off thresholds.
  --sequence            Your protein sequence can be entered directly into this form
                        in GCG, FASTA, EMBL, PIR, NBRF or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted.
                        Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain
                        applications understand the input. Note that directly using
                        data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present.
