  --sequence            Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered
                        directly into this form. The sequences must be in FASTA
                        format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted.
                        Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain
                        applications understand the input. Note that directly using
                        data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present. There is a limit
                        of 500 sequences or 1MB of data.
  --data_file           A file containing valid sequences in FASTA format can be
                        used as input for the sequence similarity search. Word
                        processors files may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present in the files. It is
                        best to save files with the Unix format option to avoid
                        hidden Windows characters.
  --tree_file           Tree file in Newick Binary Format.
  --do_njtree           compute guide tree from input alignment.
  --do_clustalw_tree    compute guide tree using Clustalw2.
  --model_file          Structure Model File.
  --output_format       Format for output alignment file.
  --trust_insertions    Trust inferred insertions and do not allow their later
                        matching.
  --show_insertions_with_dots Show gaps created by insertions as dots, deletions as dashes.
  --use_log_space       Use log space for probabilities; slower but necessary for
                        large numbers of sequences.
  --use_codon_model     Use codon substutition model for alignment; requires DNA,
                        multiples of three in length.
  --translate_DNA       Translate DNA sequences to proteins and backtranslate
                        results.
  --mt_translate_DNA    Translate DNA sequences to mt proteins, align and
                        backtranslate results.
  --gap_rate            Gap Opening Rate.
  --gap_extension       Gap Extension Probability.
  --tn93_kappa          Parameter kappa for Tamura-Nei DNA substitution model.
  --tn93_rho            Parameter rho for Tamura-Nei DNA substitution model.
  --guide_pairwise_distance Fixed pairwise distance used for generating scoring matrix
                        in guide tree computation.
  --max_pairwise_distance Maximum pairwise distance allowed in progressive steps of
                        multiple alignment; allows making matching more stringent or
                        flexible.
  --branch_length_scaling Factor for scaling all branch lengths.
  --branch_length_fixed Fixed value for all branch lengths.
  --branch_length_maximum Upper limit for branch lengths.
  --use_real_branch_lengths Use real branch lengths; using this can be harmful as
                        scoring matrices became flat for large distances; rather use
                        max_pairwise_distance.
  --do_no_posterior     Do not compute posterior probability; much faster if those
                        not needed.
  --run_once            Do not iterate alignment.
  --run_twice           Iterate alignment.
  --penalise_terminal_gaps Penalise terminal gaps as any other gap.
  --do_posterior_only   Compute posterior probabilities for given *aligned*
                        sequences; may be unstable but useful.
  --use_chaos_anchors   Use chaos anchors to massively speed up alignments; DNA only.
  --minimum_anchor_distance Minimum chaos anchor distance.
  --maximum_anchor_distance Maximum chaos anchor distance.
  --skip_anchor_distance Chaos anchor skip distance.
  --drop_anchor_distance Chaos anchor drop distance.
  --output_ancestors    Output ancestral sequences and probability profiles; note
                        additional files.
  --noise_level         Noise level; progress and debugging information.
  --stay_quiet          Stay quiet; disable all progress information.
  --random_seed         Set seed for random number generator; not recommended.
