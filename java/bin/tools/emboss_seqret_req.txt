  --stype               Indicates if the query sequence is protein, DNA or RNA.
  --inputformat         Input format name.
  --outputformat        Output format name.
  --feature             Use feature information.
  --firstonly           Read one sequence and stop.
  --reverse             Reverse-complement of input DNA sequences.
  --outputcase          Change alphabet case for output sequences.
  --seqrange            Specify a range or section of the input sequence to use in
                        the search. Example: Specifying '34-89' in an input sequence
                        of total length 100, will tell EMBOSS seqret to only use
                        residues 34 to 89, inclusive.
  --sequence            One or more sequences to be translated can be entered
                        directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA,
                        EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the
                        end of the sequence may help certain applications understand
                        the input. Note that directly using data from word
                        processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control
                        characters may be present. There is a limit of 2MB.
