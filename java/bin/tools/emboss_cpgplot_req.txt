  --sequence            One or more sequences to be analysed can be entered directly
                        into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL,
                        GenBank, PIR, NBRF or PHYLIP format. Partially formatted
                        sequences are not accepted.
  --window              The percentage CG content and the Observed frequency of CG
                        is calculated within a window whose size is set by this
                        parameter. The window is moved down the sequence and these
                        statistics are calculated at each position that the window
                        is moved to.
  --minlen              This sets the minimum length that a CpG island has to be
                        before it is reported.
  --minoe               This sets the minimum average observed to expected ratio of
                        C plus G to CpG in a set of 10 windows that are required
                        before a CpG island is reported.
  --minpc               This sets the minimum average percentage of G plus C a set
                        of 10 windows that are required before a CpG island is
                        reported.
