  --sequence            The sequence to be analysed can be entered directly into
                        this form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, PIR, NBRF,
                        PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format. Partially formatted
                        sequences are not accepted.
  --termini             Include charges from the N-terminus and C-terminus when
                        calculating the Isoelectric Point.
  --mono                Use weight from the most abundant (prinicpal) isotope of
                        each amino acid when calculating molecular weights. By
                        default this is not enabled, so the average isotope weight
                        is used instead.
