  --scorethr            Score threshold. The minimum score for a candidate hairpin.
  --longext             Long match extention (bp).
  --shortext            Short match extention (bp).
  --maxmis              Maximum mature mismatches.
  --mismatchpen         Mature mismatch penalty.
  --bowtie              Maximum allowed matches per candidate genome (Bowtie-m). 0
                        for disable.
  --excludecan          Exclude candidates in loop. Binary toggle to exclude mature.
  --maxloop             Maximum loop overlap. Maximum allowed mature basepairs
                        overlapping loop.
  --sequence            The query sequence(s) can be entered directly into this
                        form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, PIR,
                        NBRF or PHYLIP format. A partially formatted sequence is not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present. There is a limit of 1MB for the sequence entry.
  --metazoa_species     Ensembl Metazoa Species.
  --ensembl_species     Ensembl Species.
