  --sequence            One or more sequences to be analysed can be entered directly
                        into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL
                        (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially
                        formatted sequences are not accepted.
  --outputtype          Output type.
  --species             Uses the specified species table for quantile comparisons.
  --positiveresidues    By default, SAPS treats only lysine (K) and arginine (R) as
                        positively charged residues. Alternatively, Histidine (H)
                        can also be treated as positively charged in all parts of
                        the program involving the charge alphabet.
