  --format              Output format.
  --stype               Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned.
  --sequence            The input sequence can be entered directly into this form.
                        The sequence can be in FASTA or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format.
                        A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a
                        return to the end of the sequence may help certain
                        applications understand the input. Note that directly using
                        data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as
                        hidden/control characters may be present.
