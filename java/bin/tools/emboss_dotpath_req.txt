  --stype               Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned.
  --asequence           A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of
                        characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein
                        sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide
                        only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --bsequence           A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of
                        characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein
                        sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide
                        only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --wordsize            Word size.
  --overlaps            Displays the overlapping matches (in red) as well as the
                        minimal set of non-overlapping matches.
  --boxit               Draw a box around dotplot.
