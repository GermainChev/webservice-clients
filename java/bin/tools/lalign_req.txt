  --stype               Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned.
  --matrix              Default substitution scoring matrices.
  --match_scores        Specify match/mismatch scores for DNA comparisons.
  --gapopen             Pairwise alignment score for the first residue in a gap.
  --gapext              Pairwise alignment score for each additional residue in a
                        gap.
  --expthr              Limits the number of scores and alignments reported based on
                        the expectation value. This is the maximum number of times
                        the match is expected to occur by chance.
  --format              Pairwise sequences format.
  --graphics            Generates a visual output.
  --asequence           A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of
                        characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein
                        sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide
                        only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
                        directly using data from word processors may yield
                        unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be
                        present.
  --bsequence           A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of
                        characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein
                        sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide
                        only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
                        (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not
                        accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may
                        help certain applications understand the input. Note that
