  --codontable          Which Genetic Code table to use. These are kept synchronised
                        with those maintained at the NCBI's Taxonomy Browser.
  --firstorf            Count the beginning of a sequence as a possible ORF, even if
                        it's inferior to the minimal ORF size.
  --lastorf             Count the end of a sequence as a possible ORF, even if it's
                        not finishing with a STOP, or inferior to the minimal ORF
                        size.
  --reverse             Choose this option if you wish to reverse and compliment
                        your sequence.
  --orfminsize          Minimum size of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) to display in the
                        translations.
  --sequence            A DNA sequence can be entered or pasted into this box.
                        Ideally use a known sequence format such as fasta or EMBL,
                        text pasted from word processors may contain meta-characters
                        that cause problems.
