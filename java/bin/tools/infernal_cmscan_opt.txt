--thresholdmodel   	string 	Model-specific reporting thresholds.
--sequence         	string 	The input sequence can be entered directly into this form. The sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, PIR, NBRF or PHYLIP format. A partially formatted sequence is not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
