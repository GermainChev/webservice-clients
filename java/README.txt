Java Clients
============

A set of sample EBI Web Services clients developed in Java.

See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/

Building Clients
----------------

To keep the build process simple we use Apache ant to perform the build.

1. Generate the stubs from the WSDLs.

Generate all the stubs:

  ant stubs

Generate stubs for a specific SOAP library, e.g. Apache Axis 1.x:

  ant axis1-stubs

Generate stubs for a specific service, e.g. WSWUBlast:

  ant axis1-stubs-wublast

Note: since ant does not support remote dependency checking the stubs will
be re-generated each time these targets are called.

2. Compile

  ant

3. Compile and package into jars:

  ant jar

4. Package downloaded dependancies:

  ant package-dependancies

Dependanices are managed using Apache Ivy (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/), and 
are configured in ivy.xml.

Running Clients
---------------

To run a client the required jars (lib/) need to be added to the classpath. A
simple way to do this is to set the java.ext.dirs property to include the
directory containing the jars. For example:

  java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib/ -jar bin/WSDbfetch.jar

For JAX-WS under Java 5, the JAX-WS libraries also need to be included in the
path list specified for java.ext.dirs.
