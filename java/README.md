# EBI Web Services Java Clients

A set of sample EBI Web Services clients developed in Java.

See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/

## Building Clients

An Apache ant (http://ant.apache.org/) build file (build.xml) is used to
perform the build, with Apache Ivy (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) being used to
manage library dependencies (see ivy.xml).

### 1. Generate the stubs from the WSDLs.

Generate stubs from service description documents (WSDL) for all the SOAP
toolkits:
```
ant stubs
```

Generate stubs for a specific SOAP library, e.g. Apache Axis 1.x:
```
ant axis1-stubs
```

Generate stubs for a specific service for a specific library, e.g. WU-BLAST
(SOAP):
```
ant axis1-stubs-wublast
```

Note: since ant does not support remote dependency checking, and many of the
WSDLs are dynamic documents, the stubs are re-generated each time these
targets are called.

### 2. Compile
```
ant
```

or

```
ant compile
```

If compilation fails it might have happened that one of the webservices was retired, in such case:

* we did not generate correct stub for the tool
* we need to remobe classes of the tool and references to it in build.xml

To compile just the code for one of the SOAP libraries, e.g. Apache Axis 1.x:
```
ant axis1-compile
```

### 3. Compile and package into jars:
```
ant jar
```

To package just the code for one of the SOAP libraries, e.g. Apache Axis 1.x:
```
ant axis1-jar
```

### 4. Package the dependencies downloaded by Apache Ivy:
```
ant package-dependencies
```

### 5. Test the generated client jars:
```
ant test
```

To test just the jars for one of the SOAP libraries, e.g. Apache Axis 1.x:
```
ant axis1-test
```

To test just the jar for a specific service and SOAP library, e.g. WU-BLAST
(SOAP) using Apache Axis 1.x:

```
ant axis1-test-wublast
```

## Running Clients

To run a client the required jars (`lib/`) need to be added to the classpath. A
simple way to do this is to set the `java.ext.dirs` property to include the
directory containing the jars. For example:

```
java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib/ -jar jar/WSDbfetch.jar
```

For JAX-WS under Java 5, the JAX-WS libraries also need to be included in the
path list specified for `java.ext.dirs`, since these are not provided as part
of the Java installation. The JAX-WS libraries can be obtained from
https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/.
