--frame            	string 	The frames to be translated. The order of the frames follows the Staden convention: Frame -1 is the reverse-complement of the sequence having the same codon phase as frame 1. Frame -2 is the same phase as frame 2. Frame -3 is the same phase as frame 3.
--codontable       	string 	Which genetic code table to use. These are kept synchronised with those maintained at the NCBI's Taxonomy Browser.
--regions          	string 	Which regions of the user's DNA molecule are to be translated.
--trim             	boolean	Remove '*' and 'X' (stop and ambiguity) symbols from the end of the translation.
--reverse          	boolean	Choose this option if you wish to reverse and complement your input sequence before frame translation.
--sequence         	string 	Any input formats accepted by EMBOSS can be used, the full list of sequence formats accepted as input by EMBOSS tools can be accessed via the link below. Word processor files may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present in the files. It is best to save files with the Unix format option to avoid hidden Windows characters.
