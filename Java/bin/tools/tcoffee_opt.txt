--format           	string 	Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
--matrix           	string 	Matrix series to use when generating the multiple sequence alignment. The program goes through the chosen matrix series, spanning the full range of amino acid distances.
--order            	string 	The order in which the sequences appear in the final alignment
--stype            	string 	Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned
--sequence         	string 	Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered directly into this form. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is currently a sequence input limit of 500 sequences and 1MB of data.
