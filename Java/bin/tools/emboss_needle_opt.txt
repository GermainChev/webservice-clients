--matrix           	string 	Default substitution scoring matrices.
--gapopen          	float  	Pairwise alignment score for the first residue in a gap.
--gapext           	float  	Pairwise alignment score for each additional residue in a gap.
--endweight        	boolean	Apply end gap penalty
--endopen          	float  	Score taken away when an end gap is created.
--endextend        	float  	Penalty is added to the end gap penalty for each base or residue in the end gap. This is how long end gaps are penalized.
--format           	string 	Pairwise sequences format
--stype            	string 	Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned
--asequence        	string 	A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
--bsequence        	string 	A free text (raw) list of sequences is simply a block of characters representing several DNA/RNA or Protein sequences. A sequence can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present.
