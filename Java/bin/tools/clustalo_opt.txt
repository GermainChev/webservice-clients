--guidetreeout     	boolean	Output guide tree.
--dismatout        	boolean	Output distance matrix. This is only calculated if the mBed-like clustering guide tree is set to false.
--dealign          	boolean	Remove any existing alignment (gaps) from input sequences.
--mbed             	boolean	This option uses a sample of the input sequences and then represents all sequences as vectors to these sequences, enabling much more rapid generation of the guide tree, especially when the number of sequences is large.
--mbediteration    	boolean	Use mBed-like clustering during subsequent iterations.
--iterations       	integer	Number of (combined guide-tree/HMM) iterations.
--gtiterations     	integer	Having set the number of combined iterations, this parameter can be changed to limit the number of guide tree iterations within the combined iterations.
--hmmiterations    	integer	Having set the number of combined iterations, this parameter can be changed to limit the number of HMM iterations within the combined iterations.
--outfmt           	string 	Format for generated multiple sequence alignment.
--order            	string 	The order in which the sequences appear in the final alignment
--stype            	string 	Defines the type of the sequences to be aligned
--sequence         	string 	Three or more sequences to be aligned can be entered directly into this box. Sequences can be in GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) format. Partially formatted sequences are not accepted. Adding a return to the end of the sequence may help certain applications understand the input. Note that directly using data from word processors may yield unpredictable results as hidden/control characters may be present. There is currently a sequence input limit of 4000 sequences and 4MB of data.
