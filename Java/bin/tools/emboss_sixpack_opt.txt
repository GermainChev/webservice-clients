--codontable       	string 	Which Genetic Code table to use. These are kept synchronised with those maintained at the NCBI's Taxonomy Browser.
--firstorf         	boolean	Count the beginning of a sequence as a possible ORF, even if it's inferior to the minimal ORF size.
--lastorf          	boolean	Count the end of a sequence as a possible ORF, even if it's not finishing with a STOP, or inferior to the minimal ORF size.
--reverse          	boolean	Choose this option if you wish to reverse and compliment your sequence.
--orfminsize       	string 	Minimum size of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) to display in the translations.
--sequence         	string 	A DNA sequence can be entered or pasted into this box. Ideally use a known sequence format such as fasta or EMBL, text pasted from word processors may contain meta-characters that cause problems.
