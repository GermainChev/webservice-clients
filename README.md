# EMBL-EBI Web Services Clients

This repository provides a collection of Sample Web Service Clients to consume
EBI's Job Dispatcher Web Service tools via REST and SOAP APIs.

The RESTful API interface for the Job Dispatcher Web Services is available at
[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/common/tools/help/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/common/tools/help/)

## Sample Clients

A collection of REST sample clients for the EBI Job Dispatcher Web Services in Python, Perl and Java.
These clients are generated from the service (XML) description with
[https://github.com/ebi-wp/webservice-clients-generator](https://github.com/ebi-wp/webservice-clients-generator)

* [Perl](perl)
* [Python](python)
* [Java](java)

*Note:* A number of "older" REST and SOAP clients in a range of programming languages is now [deprecated](deprecated)
but still available for those who might be interested. In addition to Perl, Python and Java, clients are available
in C#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby and PHP, using a variety of different REST/SOAP libraries.


## Running the clients

[Download the clients](https://github.com/ebi-wp/webservice-clients/archive/master.zip)
or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ebi-wp/webservice-clients.git
```

### Perl clients [![perl](https://img.shields.io/badge/perl-5.22.0+-blue.svg?style=flat)]()

In order to run Perl clients, Perl (tested version 5.22.0) needs to installed as well as Perl dependencies. Additional instruction on how to install Perl and its decencies is [provided here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/Environment+setup+for+REST+Web+Services).

Install dependencies with:
```bash
# To install Perl dependencies run (you might need sudo)
cpan LWP
cpan XML::Simple
cpan YAML::Syck
cpan JSON::XS
```

An example test for Clustal Omega Perl client:

```bash
perl clustalo.pl --email <your@email.com> --sequence sp:wap_rat,sp:wap_mouse,sp:wap_pig
```

### Python clients [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.5+-blue.svg?style=flat)]()

Specially if you have no root access to your machine, you might need to
use [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
Prepare a virtual environment where all the Python (tested version 3.6.5) dependencies will be installed. Additional instruction on how to install Python and its decencies is [provided here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/Environment+setup+for+REST+Web+Services).

```bash
virtualenv -p `which python` env
source ./env/bin/activate
# deactivate
```

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install --upgrade xmltramp2
```

An example test for Clustal Omega Python client:

```bash
python clustalo.py --email <your@email.com> --sequence sp:wap_rat,sp:wap_mouse,sp:wap_pig
```

### Java clients [![java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-1.8+-blue.svg?style=flat)]()

In order to run Java clients, Java (tested version 1.8.0_161") as well as ant (tested version 1.10.5),
needs to installed. Additional instruction on how to install Java and its decencies is [provided here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/Environment+setup+for+REST+Web+Services).

The Java source code needs to be compiled with `ant` as follows:
```bash
# if ant build fails on the first run, try the command again
ant -lib lib
```

An example test for Clustal Omega Java client:

```bash
java -jar clustalo.jar --email <your@email.com> --sequence sp:wap_rat,sp:wap_mouse,sp:wap_pig
```

## Running clients with Docker

You can run the Sample Clients with Docker. We provide a docker container at
https://hub.docker.com/r/ebiwp/webservice-clients/. Pull the `webservice-clients` container from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull ebiwp/webservice-clients
```

Then run the Perl (or Python and Java) Clients with:
```
docker run --rm -it ebiwp/webservice-clients ncbiblast.pl --help
```

You can control input/output with `--volumes` or simply `-v`:
```
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/results -w /results ebiwp/webservice-clients ncbiblast.pl  \
  --email <your@email.com> --stype protein --database uniprotkb_swissprot --program blastp sp:pak4_human
```

## Perl clients in BioContainers

EBI Web Service Perl Clients are also available through [BioContainers](http://biocontainers.pro/).

```
docker pull biocontainers/ebi-webservice
```
